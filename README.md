The objective for this analysis is to identify key areas of performance, including Revenue generated, Average profit margin over the years, Regional performance, Product performance, and trend in sales.

**Objectives Include:**
1. Determine the general sales performance for the business
2. Uncover the profit generated and average profit margin for the business
3. Identify which products are the most performing by revenue 
4. Compare product performance by revenue and profit
5. Establish which regions are performing

**Key Insights**

**1. Revenue Generation**
The business generated a strong total revenue of $9.37M across 2003–2005, with 3K total orders and an average order value of $3.21K. The model suggests a mid-to-high-ticket product strategy that is working effectively.

**2. Seasonal Sales Spike**
The analysis demonstrated a spike in sales across quarter 3 in both 2003 and 2004. This demonstrates a seasonal sales trend. This discovery tells more about the customer acquisition behavior. This should inform inventory planning and marketing plans towards the end of 2005.

**3. Product Performance** 
The 1992 Ferrari 360 Spider red and 1952 Alpine Renault 1300 are the leading products with sales totaling $ 271,014.78 and $ 190,017.96, respectively. However, the product seems to be trailing in profit margin with 1937 Horch 930V Limousine (69,120.97) and 1961 Chevrolet Impala (69120.97) leading at 55.74% and 55.65% as profit margin.

**4. Product Line Performance**
Classic Cars: $3.77M and Vintage Cars $1.76M are the leading product lines in sales, making up attributing to 59.04% of the total revenue, overshadowing categories like Ships, Trains, and Trucks. Motorcycles and Vintage cars are the leading product lines by profit margin, with a margin of 40.74% and 40.38% respectively.

**5. Regional Performance**
The United States drives the most global sales. USA exceeds $3.32M, almost one-third of all revenue. Spain, France, Australia, the UK, and New Zealand follow with much smaller contributions (~$1.1M or less). This demonstrates high market maturity in the U.S. and strong customer affinity. While the Philippines seems to be trailing in revenue /sales ($87,468.3), it is the most performing country by profit margin (40.54%). This could indicate a very low market share and product knowledge, hence very low sales.

**Recommendations**

1. Improve marketing across low sales and high profit margin performance markets like the Philippines and Japan (167, 909.95, 40.28%). This will increase market share and enhance sales performance. This will eventually lead to higher purchases and subsequent profit spikes, as proven by the analysis.
2. Increase marketing initiative toward the end of Q3 2005 to tap into the Q4 sales surge. The supply chain department should also focus on ensuring there is ready inventory to serve the incoming demand.
3. Expand Classic, Vintage, and Motorcycle product lines since they generate 70.97% of revenue and profit margin. Expanding colors, trims, editions, and bundles will likely increase overall revenue and increase profit margin.
